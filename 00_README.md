  - Types of Problems (Regression & Classification)
  - Techniques: Linear, Logistic, SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, etc.
  - Neural Networks (MLP, Feedforward)
  - Model Evaluation (Bias-Variance, Cross Validation)

- **02_Unsupervised_Learning/**
  - Clustering (k-Means, Hierarchical)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

- **03_Deep_Learning/**
  - (Coming soon...)
